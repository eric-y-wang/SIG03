# SIG03_R_240706
Analysis of SIG03

### Goal
* Test new T7oBC5p barcode detection at different viral titers
* Test PT of different immune populations

### Approach
Naive CD4 T cells were harvested from Foxp3-RFP mice and activated in-vitro (24h or 42h). At 24h or 6h prior to collection, activated cells were pseudotransduced with different contrations of virus in a sequential manner. 48h in-vitro activated Tregs, fresh splenocytes, and Jurkat cells were also pseudotransduced. Virus was produced using p123 membrane display and p139 barcodes.
